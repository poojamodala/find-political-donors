This is the directory where your source code would reside.

Approach was to use a hashmap and calculate the medians of the donors based on zipcode and date.

to run the java file, please use run.sh and need to give 2 parameters as input:
param1: input file
param2: output folder location.

Eg:
javac "/Users/keerthivasan86/git/find-political-donors/src/findPoliticalDonors/FindPoliticalDonors.java"

java -cp /Users/git/find-political-donors/src/ findPoliticalDonors.FindPoliticalDonors /Users/git/find-political-donors/insight_testsuite/tests/test_1/input/itcont.txt /Users/git/find-political-donors/insight_testsuite/tests/test_1/output
